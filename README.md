# README

This is a template repository for a Quarto course website. Since I
intend to use this template myself, quite a bit of of the syllabus
information in `syllabus/policies/` is specific to my institution.

## Github Pages Deployment

There is a github action file in `.github/workflows` with most of the
content commented out, because I don’t want to deploy this template.

See the Quarto docs about [deploying to
github](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).

## Licensing

I’ve licensed the *template* itself CC-BY 4.0. But you may re-license
any actual course content you add as you see fit.
