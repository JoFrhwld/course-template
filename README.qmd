This is a template repository for a Quarto course website. Since I intend to use this template myself, quite a bit of of the syllabus information in `syllabus/policies/` is specific to my institution.

## Licensing

I've licensed the *template* itself CC-BY 4.0. But you may re-license any actual course content you add as you see fit.
