### Regular and Substantive Interaction

<details>**Regular and Substantive Interaction**: All credit-bearing courses must support regular and substantive interaction (RSI) between the students and the instructor, regardless of the course's delivery mode (e.g., in-person, hybrid, or online).
Courses satisfy this requirement when course participants meet regularly as prescribed in SR 10.6, and the Instructor of Record substantively interacts with students in at least two of the following ways: provides direct instruction; assesses students' learning; provides information or responds to students' questions; and facilitates student discussions.
Some exceptions allowed as per SACSCOC.
For further information about the RSI requirement, see the [[Compliance Resources]{.underline}](https://www.uky.edu/tlai/compliance-faculty) link on the Teaching, Learning and Academic Innovation Compliance page.</details>
