### Verification of Absences

<details>**Verification of Absences**:Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to be considered excused. *Senate Rule 5.2.5.2.1* states that faculty have the right to request appropriate verification when students claim an excused absence due to: significant illness; death in the household, trips for classes, trips sponsored by an educational unit and trips for participation related to intercollegiate athletic events; and interviews for full-time job opportunities after graduation and interviews for graduate and professional school. (Appropriate notification of absences due to University-related trips is required prior to the absence when feasible and in no case more than one week after the absence.)</details>
