<details>**Verification of Absences**:Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to be considered excused.
Administrative Regulation â€” Academic and Student Affairs states that faculty have the right to request appropriate verification when students claim an excused absence due to: significant illness; death in the household, trips for classes, trips sponsored by an educational unit and trips for participation related to intercollegiate athletic events; and interviews for full-time job opportunities after graduation and interviews for graduate and professional school.
(Appropriate notification of absences due to university-related trips is required prior to the absence when feasible and in no case more than one week after the absence.)</details>
