[UK Senate DEI Statement](https://universitysenate.uky.edu/syllabus-statement-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei)

The University of Kentucky is committed to our core values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and human dignity, and a sense of community ([[Governing Regulations XIV]{.underline}](https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14)). We acknowledge and respect the seen and unseen diverse identities and experiences of all members of the university community (<https://www.uky.edu/regs/gr14>). These identities include but are not limited to those based on race, ethnicity, gender identity and expressions, ideas and perspectives, religious and cultural beliefs, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ability, and socioeconomic status. We are committed to equity and justice and providing a learning and engaging community in which every member is engaged, heard, and valued.

We strive to rectify and change behavior that is inconsistent with our principles and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. If students encounter such behavior in a course, they are encouraged to speak with the instructor of record and/or the [[Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity]{.underline}](https://www.uky.edu/eeo/). Students may also contact a faculty member within the department, program director, the director of undergraduate or graduate studies, the department chair, any college administrator, or the dean. All of these individuals are mandatory reporters under University policies.
